#  Turtle Race Game

Hey there! Welcome to my simple Python Turtle Racing game. I built this as a fun way to practice using loops and random numbers in Python.

##  What does it do?
It's a digital turtle race! Six differently colored turtles line up at the starting line. Before the race begins, the game asks you to place a bet on which color you think will win. Once you guess, the turtles start moving toward the finish line. 

Because every turtle moves a random distance on every turn, you never know who is going to win until the very end!

##  How to Play
1. A small box will pop up on your screen asking: *"Which turtle will win the race?"*
2. Type in your favorite color out of these six: **red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple**.
3. Hit OK, and watch them run!
4. Look at your computer's text console at the end of the race to see if you won your bet. Click anywhere on the race track to close the game.

##  How to run it on your computer
You just need to have Python installed on your computer to play. 

1. Download the `race.py` file to your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Go to the folder where you saved the file.
4. Type `python race.py` and hit Enter!
